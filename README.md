# Time evolution of a Heisenberg chain on a quantum computer

## File structure

The primary report is `FinalProject_JWilliams.pdf`; the quantum code is run from
`UnitaryEv_Heisenberg.ipynb`; the classical code is run in 
`FinalProject_exact.nb`; and the plot for the simple error model is generated
from `Error.py`.
